# Real time Chat App using Spring Boot and Websockets

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## Overview of the Application

<br/><br/>
Basically we will be creating chat broker where all the users are connected to it. So if any message is sent from any user it will then be sent (dispatched) to other users connected to the broker.
<br/><br/>
If any users leave or exit the connection that information is also will be passed to the other users connected to the broker.
